/*
The setInterval(cb, ms) global function is used to run callback cb 
repeatedly after at least ms milliseconds. The actual delay depends 
on external factors like OS timer granularity and system load. A timer 
cannot span more than 24.8 days.

This function returns an opaque value that represents the timer which 
can be used to clear the timer using the function clearInterval(t).

    console.log( "Hello, World!");

 // Now call above function after 2 seconds
 setInterval(printHello, 2000);
